Source script for "The Naive Bayes Algorithm: Step by Step"

This script steps through the naive Bayes algorithm using standard R functions. The goal is not to come up with production-level code--R already has that--but to use R for the "grunt work" needed to implement the algorithm. This lets us focus on how naive Bayes makes predictions, rather than the mechanics of probability calculations.
